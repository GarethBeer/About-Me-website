          I am an aspiring software developer and my first project is to create
          a website, so here it is! Keep on scrolling if you would like to know

          I have a passion for IT and have from an early age but have never done
          anything with it, I have always been fairly technically minded and
          enjoyed tinkering on computers as well as taking them apart just for
          the sake of it. Having spent evenings completing challenges on
          codeacademy and freecodecamp I thought it was time to put my money
          where my mouth is and prove to myself and others that I can do this
          for real. That is why I decided to take the plunge and book on the

            My dream would be to work within the snow sports or the adventure
            tourism industry as a developer so that I could combine my two
            passions into a career. Wish me luck! ü§ûüèª

          I gained a 2:1 Bsc Honours degree in Biomedical Science Degree at the
          University Of Salford. I have always been very interested in the human
          body and science as a wider topic which stemmed from my love of sports
          and exercising.

          After University I got offered a contracting role working for Bank of
          America within their complaints department, what initially should have
          been a short term 6 month contract turned into an 18month contract! It
          was a good experience of a target driven, highly regulated work
          environmnet and gave me a lot of transferable skills. I really got to
          grips with Microsoft Office software such as Excel, Word and
          PowerPoint.

          I then decided to pursue a dream of mine before I settled down into a
          career so I moved out to Canada and became a ski Instructor ‚õ∑. I spent
          two seasons as a full time instructor at Mount Norquay ski resort in
          Banff, Alberta. In the summers I found my passion for the great
          outdoors by hiking, learning to rock climb, mountain biking and wild
          camping. I then spent a winter season in Australia as a ski instructor
          as well as a few months travelling WA and Victoria
