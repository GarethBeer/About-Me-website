            <p>
                 I have a passion for IT and have from an early age but have never done anything with it, I have always been fairly technically minded and enjoyed tinkering on computers as well as taking them apart just for the sake of it. That is why I decided to take the plunge and book on the <a href="https://www.manchestercodes.com" alt="link to Mnchester Codes main website" target="_blank" id="mcrcodeslink">MCR codes</a> software engineering fastrack course because it would give me the push to turn a geniune interest and passion into a career. A career that is currently in high demand. Having spent evenings completing challenges on codeacademy and freecodecamp I thought it was time to put my money where my mouth is and prove to myself and others that I can do this for real. My dream would be to find work within the snow sports industry or the adventure tourism industry as a developer so that I could combine my two passions into a career which is based around what I love doing. Wish me luck!

                    <h4>Climbing</h4>
                     <p>I enjoy anything that involves getting outside so will try pretty much anything but my main hobby is a bit of climbing and bouldering! I love it. I started just under a year ago properly and have been going once a week most weeks ever since. In the winter I would do indoor bouldering and then as soon as the warm weather rolled in I bought the gear and started venturing off outside to do some sport climbing and some bouldering. I have climbed predominately in a place called Trevor rocks which over looks the town of LLangollen but I have also climbed in Tremadog and in Canada. Outside climbing is incredible as you get to see and get to some real cool places that not many people have the opportunity to get to! It is a good physical workout but it also works the brain! Each route is called a 'problem' and you have to work out what you need to do to complete it (reach the top) so I think I enjoy it so much as it works the brain as well as body - see a problem - find a way to solve it. speak a bunch of latin Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

                <h4>Skiing</h4>
            <p>Skiing is another love of mine! I spent two years living in the canadian rockies and over the course of two winters I spent well 250 days on snow. I then moved to the ski hills in Aus and spent over another 100 days on snow. That was a combination of instructing and free skiing. I thoroughly enjoyed the instructing side of things but free skiing is where it is at. The benefit of doing seasons is you aren't a slave to the weather like you are on holidays. You are around for all the good powder days and a fair share of the freezing cold windy days. Before I moved to Canada I used to go skiing once a year, started with family and family friends then when I was old enough I went with friends. I haven't been since I got home from Aus last October so I am desperate to go out this season for a week or two. One day I hope to be able to go back and work within the snow sports industry but in a software engineering side </p>
