            <p>
                 I have a passion for IT and have from an early age. It first started when we got a new family computer when I was a kid and the old one was going spare, so I took it to my room and began to dismantle it bit by bit because I was curious as to what was inside but then I panicked because I had no idea what I was doing but with a bit of trial and error I managed to put it all back together again, and the moment I plugged it in and it not only didnt blow up in my face but it switched on and booted up I was hooked. I spent months tracing RJ45 cables around the house trying to set up a LAN in the house which was a lot harder when googling wasn't anything like it is today. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Granted, It has been a while since I have touched the hardware on a computer let alone put one together but over the course of the next few months I am going to give it a go and build myself a desktop computer! However it is the software side of things which have caught my eye over the last few years, I have been apart of that age group where I have seen the UI evolve over the years to what it is today and I am 100% determined to get in on the action and be a part of what it becomes tomorrow!
            </p>
        
             <p>
                 That is why I decided to take the plunge and book on the <a href="https://www.manchestercodes.com" alt="link to Mnchester Codes main website" target="_blank">MCR codes</a> software engineering fastrack course because it would give me the push to turn a geniune interest and passion into a career. A career that is currently in high demand. Having spent evenings completing challenges on codeacademy and freecodecamp I thought it was time to put my money where my mouth is and prove to myself and others that I can do this for real. Wish me luck!

                    <h4>Climbing</h4>
                     <p>I enjoy anything that involves getting outside so will try pretty much anything but my main hobby is a bit of climbing and bouldering! I love it. I started just under a year ago properly and have been going once a week most weeks ever since. In the winter I would do indoor bouldering and then as soon as the warm weather rolled in I bought the gear and started venturing off outside to do some sport climbing and some bouldering. Outside climbing is incredible as you get to see and get to some real cool places that not many people have the opportunity to get to! It is a good physical workout but it also works the brain! Each route is called a 'problem' and you have to work out what you need to do to complete it (reach the top) so I think I enjoy it so much as it works the way my brain works - see a problem - find a way to solve it. Once you complete it doesn't mean it is over, thats when you go back and think well that move didn't feel right, what other moves could I do to make it easier

                <h4>Skiing</h4>
            <p>Skiing is another love of mine, if you have seen my work experience you will know I worked as a Ski instructor for 3 seasons! Best experience of my life! Skiing to me is like crack to a drug addict I honestly can't get enough so when I returned home it was difficult to adjust to not skiing everyday. I love the feeling of just cruising down a snow covered mountain surronded by views of endless snow covered mountain tops, feeling the rush as you hit a cliff drop into fresh powder and float through tress in fresh powder! When done right, it is effortless, no strains on the joints like running but you are getting a workout </p>
